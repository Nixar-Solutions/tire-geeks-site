    bio: "Moni Tariq owns Tire Geeks and runs both Sacramento shops — Florin Road in South Sac, Arden Way on the north end. Twenty years in the tire and wheel trade, most of those years managing multiple shops before he founded Tire Geeks with his brother Qassam. He sets the standard for how the business runs: honest fitment, no chain-shop database lookups, no upsells, real Acima approval for working drivers. If a customer walks out unsatisfied, Moni hears about it. Most don't. Walk in either store any day Mon–Sat and the shop runs the way it does because Moni built it that way.",

Twenty years in the tire and wheel trade, with most of those years spent helping run and open shops across multiple markets — California to El Paso, Texas. He's the operations and growth side of the business. While Moni runs the day-to-day at the Sacramento stores, Qassam is the one figuring out where to expand next, what new lines to bring in, and how to keep the customer experience the same as the brand grows. The Tariq brothers built Tire Geeks together and run it with the same standards the chain shops gave up on a long time ago.",

He's new to the tire industry on paper, but he isn't new to running operations. The same systems thinking that took Akorbi from an idea to an exit is what he's bringing to the way Tire Geeks handles inventory, customer experience, financing flow, and shop-to-shop consistency as the business grows. The reason a Tire Geeks customer can walk into Florin Road or Arden Way and get the same answer to the same question — that's the kind of thing Azam pays attention to.",
